| pipeVideoStreamToCanvas      | A function which accepts an HTMLCanvasElement for displaying video content. Generally it's a better idea to use the [`VideoDisplay`](#videodisplay) component, which uses this internally.                                 |

| onSeekPreview                | A function which should be called as the seek time is updated, with the new time value as an argument (the resulting behavior depends on the `seekMode` prop passed to [`PlayerContextProvider`](#playercontextprovider)). |
| onSeekComplete               | A function which should be called in two scenarios: 1. When a time seek has completed (the user has released the mouse), it should be called with **no arguments** to seek to the last time value provided to `onSeekPreview`. Don't forget this! 2. It can be called with a **number argument** that specifies a time to seek to immediately (no need to call `onSeekPreview` first). |
| onSetVolume                  | A function which should be called as volume adjustments are made, with the new volume as an argument.                                                                                                                      |

| onToggleMuted                | A function which can be called with no arguments to toggle the `muted` state, or with a boolean argument to set the `muted` value directly.                                                                                |
| onToggleShuffle              | A function which can be called with no arguments to toggle the `shuffle` state, or with a boolean argument to set the `shuffle` value directly.                                                                            |
